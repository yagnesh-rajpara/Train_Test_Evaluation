# AI & ML Internship – Task 5  
## Train–Test Split & Model Evaluation (Heart Disease Dataset)

This repository contains the solution for **Task 5: Train–Test Split & Evaluation Metrics** as part of the **AI & ML Internship**.  
The goal of this task is to train a machine learning model and evaluate its performance using standard classification metrics.

---

## 📌 Dataset Used
- **Heart Disease Dataset (heart.csv)**  
  A medical dataset containing patient health attributes used to predict the presence of heart disease.

**Target Variable:**  
- `target`  
  - 0 → No heart disease  
  - 1 → Heart disease  

---

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  
- Jupyter Notebook  

---

## 🎯 Task Objectives
- Split the dataset into training and testing sets  
- Train a **Logistic Regression** model  
- Make predictions on unseen test data  
- Evaluate the model using:
  - Accuracy  
  - Precision  
  - Recall  
- Analyze model performance using a **Confusion Matrix**  

---

## 📊 Work Performed
- Dataset loading and inspection  
- Feature–target separation  
- Train–test split (80% training, 20% testing)  
- Logistic Regression model training  
- Prediction on test data  
- Performance evaluation using classification metrics  
- Confusion matrix visualization and interpretation
